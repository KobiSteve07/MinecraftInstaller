KobiWare Minecraft Installer

Installs Minecraft launcher on Windows using Python coded EXE, whether you have an account or not.
To download the installer go to https://github.com/KobiSteve07/MinecraftInstaller/releases.
Windows Defender's SmartScreen may appear when you run it. To pass it, hit more info, run anyways. This software is not a virus, I just haven't gotten my code signed.
